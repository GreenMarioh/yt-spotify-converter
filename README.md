## üöÄ How to Run This Project

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GreenMarioh/yt-spotify-converter.git
cd spotify-youtube-converter
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up your `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret

YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID=your_youtube_client_id

### 4. Run the backend server

```bash
node index.js

This will start the backend on `http://127.0.0.1:8888`.

Make sure your frontend is served on `http://localhost:3000` as it's hardcoded in the redirect URIs.
